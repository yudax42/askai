## How it works

`askai` uses the [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) library to open a headless Chromium browser and interact with the ChatGPT website. When you run the `askai login` command, the browser will open and you can login to your ChatGPT account. Once you are logged in, `askai` can use the browser to send and receive messages from the ChatGPT model.
